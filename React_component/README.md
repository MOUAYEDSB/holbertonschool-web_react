## Introduction

The React Component Development project is designed to deepen understanding and proficiency in building robust and reusable components using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Throughout the project, learners will explore various aspects of React development, including component lifecycle, event handling, performance optimization, and testing.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Commence with class components**: Convert functional components to class components.
2. **Lifecycles**: Implement lifecycle methods in a component and write corresponding tests.
3. **Handling Events**: Create event handling functions and test them.
4. **Reusable Comments & Specialization**: Create reusable components and specialize them.
5. **Use the New Components**: Integrate newly created components into the main App component.
6. **Test the New Components**: Write tests for the newly created components.
7. **Create WithLogging HOC**: Implement a Higher Order Component for logging component lifecycle events.
8. **Write a Test for the HOC**: Write tests for the Higher Order Component.
9. **Declare a Pure Component**: Modify a component to make it a pure component.
10. **Make Your Own Pure Component**: Implement a pure component and optimize its rendering.
11. **Add a Test**: Write tests to verify the performance optimization.
