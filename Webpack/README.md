# Webpack üíª

<img src='image/images.png' title='redmepc'>

## Description: üí¨
Webpack is a powerful and popular JavaScript bundler used to compile modules and their dependencies into static files. It builds a dependency graph that maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles. Webpack can handle not only JavaScript but, with the use of loaders, it also integrates other asset types like CSS, images, and HTML into your projects. It features a robust plugin system to extend its functionality, optimizing everything from asset management to environment variable injection. Webpack supports multiple modes such as development and production, tailoring the build process to suit different stages of development. It also includes a development server that updates browsers in real-time as code changes, enhancing the development experience.

## What we should learn from this project: üìë
- How to setup Webpack for a basic project
- Entry points, output, and loaders
- How to add plugins
- How to split your code into chunks
- How to setup a dev server

## Tasks üìö
### 0. Basic setup
1. Create and run Webpack using a basic installation.
    - Create a folder named `task_0`.
    - Install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as developer dependencies within the folder using `npm`.
    - Install `jQuery` as a regular dependency using `npm`.
    - Make sure that `webpack` and `webpack-cli` are listed under the `devDependencies` key along with `jQuery` being listed under the `dependencies` key within the `package.json`.
    - Create a `src` directory with an `index.js` in it.
    - Create a `dist/index.html`. Import your `main.js` in the body.
    - You must use jQuery to add the elements to the body of the page.
    - When running Webpack, your JavaScript and HTML files should be generated in a `dist` folder.
    - You should not use a custom webpack config file.
    - Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
    - Your HTML code should only import one JavaScript script (the one generated by webpack).
    - Do NOT push your `dist/main.js` if you have one.

### 1. Learning how to use Webpack with a config file
1. Installing packages
    - Create a folder named `task_1`, `cd` into it, and create a `package.json` using `npm init -y`.
    - Install `webpack` (dev dependency), `jQuery` (dependency), and `Lodash` (dependency) within the folder using `npm`.
    - Modify your `package.json` to add a build script that runs webpack to create a production build. This lets you execute `npm run build` on the command line.
2. Using jQuery
    - Create a `js` directory with a JavaScript file named `dashboard_main.js` in it.
    - Write a function called `updateCounter()` that tracks the number of times the button element has been clicked.
    - Each time it‚Äôs called, update the count by 1 and set the content of the paragraph element with id=‚Äòcount‚Äô to {count} clicks on the button
    - Bind the debounce function in Lodash to the click event on the button you created previously (The number of milliseconds to delay invocation should be 500).
    - When running Webpack, your javascript should be generated in a `public` folder. You should also place your `index.html` in this folder.
    - The JavaScript file generated by Webpack should be named `bundle.js`
    - Set Webpack config mode to production
    - Opening your HTML file should not generate any error in the console
    - Your HTML code should only import one JavaScript script (the one generated by webpack)

### 2. Adding CSS & Images
1. Create a specific configuration for Webpack.
    - Using the folder named `task_2`.
    - Reuse the code from `task_1`.
    - Modify the webpack config to support adding CSS to the bundle.
    - Modify the webpack config to support adding images to the CSS.
    - Create a folder named `css`.
    - When running Webpack, your JavaScript and HTML files should be generated in a `public` folder.
    - The JavaScript file generated by Webpack should be named `bundle.js`.
    - Set Webpack config mode to production.
    - Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
    - When running Webpack, you should not see the warning `WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit`

### 3. Dev servers, modules, and tree shaking
1. Using the folder named `task_3`. Set up a development server:
    - Reuse the code from `task_2`.
    - Modify the Webpack config to setup a development server running on the port 8564.
    - Modify the Webpack config to set its mode to development.
    - Add a script in the package.json to start the server and open the browser with `npm run start-dev`.
2. Divide the code into modules:
    - Divide the main bundle into three modules.
    - header should contain a `header.css` and `header.js` files.
    - body should contain a `body.css` and `body.js` files.
    - footer should contain a `footer.css` and `footer.js` files.
    - Modify the Webpack configuration to support three different entry points (header, body, footer). Each entry point should generate a filename with the following format `name_of_the_file.bundle.js`.
3. Improve development speed
    - Modify the webpack config to support inline source mapping.
    - Add a plugin to Webpack to clean your build folder on each build.
4. Improve bundles size:
    - Modify the Webpack configuration to split the modules in chunks.
    
## Requirements:
- When running the dev server, your code should work on `http://localhost:8564/`.
- When running Webpack, your JavaScript and HTML files should be generated in a `public` folder.
- Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
