## Description 💬

- TypeScript, created by Microsoft in 2012, extends JavaScript with optional static typing. This feature allows developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, and more, catching errors during development. TypeScript code transcompiles to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all JavaScript environments. It improves code documentation, autocompletion, and refactoring in IDEs, and supports modern JavaScript features like ES6+. Additionally, TypeScript introduces advanced concepts such as enums, interfaces, and generics for writing more expressive and scalable code.
